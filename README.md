# pciids

When we run `lspci`, we can see pci device names there. The story behind is that many peoples update their interesting device name into a centralized db file by hand.

This effort helps a lot of Linux users' life easy. However, sometimes, the procedure needs a lot of time to spend that happens.

For big science facilities around world, typically, it is a painful effort to follow the private sector practices.

This repository was introduced to overcome this issue at least with minimum resouces and contains a few hardware PCIID database information. 

One can update the generic pci id file by the following commands


```
$ bash replace_pciids.bash

```
It will replace your local pciids with the repository pciids. 

The following hardware pciid defintions are in this repository.
